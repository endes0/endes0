### Hi there 👋
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=endes0.endes0)

I like breaking devices (and sometimes reverse engineering it), low-level programming, hardware design, data analysis ...

Currently studying and working in some small projects(which I will publish... someday), also learning c++ and python🐍.
